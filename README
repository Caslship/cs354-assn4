ABOUT
-----
This particular program implements and allows for management of a scenegraph to transform,
animate, and display .obj files, lights, and a camera.

SCENE GRAPH NODES
-----------------
The scene graph is initialized to contain a camera, light, and object node as children and the
object node contains a geometry node as a child. Order of children is sensitive when traversing
the scene graph and rendering its contents. Here is a list of the types of nodes that may exist
within the scene graph:

-- Object nodes: Represent a coordinate and rendering frame for its children (like a seperator).
-- Geometry nodes: Represent graphical meshes (contain .obj file data).
-- Transform nodes: Represent transforms (scale, translate, rotate) to be performed and can represent animations.
-- Attribute nodes: Represent different render modes (point, wireframe, solid, shaded, face norms, vertex norms).
-- Light nodes: Represent lights within the scene graph.
-- Camera node: Represents the camera within the scene graph.

MOUSE CONTROLS
--------------
The mouse is used for navigating the view space and has several different features:

-- Left click & drag: Orbit around the point of interest.
-- Middle click & drag: Pan the object.
-- Right click & drag: Zoom in/out on the point of interest.

KEYBOARD COMMANDS
-----------------
With the window as active (make sure the display window is clicked on), you enter
hotkeys to affect the program:

-- [ESC]: Quit application.

GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE
------------------------
Powered by the GLUI library, a simple (albeit hard to work with) graphical user interface
has been implemented to navigate and manage the scene graph. Here are a list of the components
and their effect:

-- "Edit Scene Graph" panel: Contains tools to navigate and modify the structure of the scene graph.
---- "Node Selection" panel: Navigation tools for the scene graph given a current node
------ "Child" listbox: Used to select a particular child of the current node.
------ "Select Child" button: Navigate to a selected child node and set as the current node. 
------ "Select Parent" button: Navigate to the parent node and set as the current node.
---- "Node Addition" panel: Modification tools for the structure of the scene graph given a current node.
------ "Type" listbox: Used to select the type of node to be added to scene graph.
------ "Add Child" button: Add a child node to the current node.
------ "Add Parent" button: Inject a parent node between the current node and its parent.
-- "Edit Current Node" panel: Contains tools to modify node-type-specific parameters of the current node.
---- "Attribute" panel: Modify parameters of an attribute node.
------ "Render" listbox: Set the render mode (point, wireframe, solid, shaded, face norms, vertex norms).
---- "Geometry" panel: Modify parameters of a geometry node.
------ "Obj" string text field: Set the path to the .obj file to be rendered.
---- "Transformation" panel: Modify parameters of a transformation node.
------ "Type" listbox: Set the type of transformation (scale, translate, rotate).
------ "Animation" checkbox: Read the transformation parameters to perform an animation.
------ "X" float text field: Set the X parameter of the transformation (changes with type).
------ "Y" float text field: Set the Y parameter of the transformation (changes with type).
------ "Z" float text field: Set the Z parameter of the transformation (changes with type).
------ "Theta" float text field: Set the Theta parameter of the transformation (rotations only).
---- "Camera" panel: Modify parameters of the camera node.
------ "FOV" float text field: Set the field-of-view.
------ "Viewport X" int text field: Set the start X coordinate of the viewport.
------ "Viewport Y" int text field: Set the start Y coordinate fo the viewport.
---- "Light" panel: Modify parameters of a light node.
------ "Type" listbox: Set the type of light (point, directional).
---- "Update" button: Update the current node to reflect changes made to node-type-specific parameters.
---- "Delete" button: Delete the current node and set its parent as the current node afterward.

EXTRA CREDIT
------------
Please take note of the following when grading:

-- Up to 8 different lights can be placed within the scene
-- Transformation nodes can be used as animations (see "Graphical User Interface" section)
