COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS
----------------------
The program accepts a limited number of command line switches:

-f <inputfilename>: Read in a file as a series of commands to execute.
-d: Run the program in debug mode.

MOUSE CONTROLS
--------------
The mouse is used for navigating the view space and has several different features:

-- Left click & drag: Orbit around the point of interest.
-- Middle click & drag: Pan the object.
-- Right click & drag: Zoom in/out on the point of interest.

KEYBOARD COMMANDS
-----------------
With the window as active (make sure the display window is clicked on), different key
sequences can be input and executed to affect the current view. You may see this input 
through console output. Input a key sequence and press enter to execute a command:

-- L <objectfilename>: Load and display the specified .obj file.
-- D: Pop current object from display stack. Displays previous object.
-- I: Load the identity matrix as the modeling transform.
-- M <render>: Set render mode. The default is solid mode. Options:
---- P: Point mode (just draw vertices).
---- W: Wireframe mode (draw the edges of the mesh).
---- S: Solid mode (draw filled triangles).
---- L: Shaded mode (basic lighting).
---- F: Face normals (basic lighting and rough shading).
---- V: Vertex normals (basic lighting and smooth shading).
-- T <tx> <ty> <tz>: Add a translation to the current modeling transformation.
-- S <sx> <sy> <sz>: Add a scale to the current modeling transformation.
-- R <theta> <ax> <ay> <az>: Add a rotation to the current modeling transformation.
-- V: Subsequent transformations are interpreted in view coordinates.
-- W: Subsequent transformations are interpreted in world coordinates (default setting).
-- Z: Toggle on/off debug mode.
-- Q: Quit the application.
-- [ENTER]: Execute current command.
-- [ESC]: Quit application.

DEBUG MODE
----------
The main point of debug mode was to aid me in ensuring program correctness. While in this
mode, the user will experience:

-- Writing information about executed keyboard commands to console.
-- A square as the default model to display when no object is loaded.
-- Trippy colors while in "solid mode" (see "Keyboard Commands").
-- Rendering of normal vector lines protruding from models (changes with render mode).
-- An initial bounding rectangle for the object to keep track of V/W transformations

EXTRA CREDIT
------------
There are a number of extra features added to the program that may possibly taken into 
consideration when grading:

-- An extra command-line switch to start the program in debug mode
-- A debug mode that displays useful artifacts on the model or information in the console
-- Adjusted zoom of camera upon loading an object so that it fits comfortably on the screen
